Hello. I make videos, and most of my repos are tools for making video production easier. I may also post code for hobby electronics projects, I'm a big Arduino guy.

My main long-term project is a piece of knowledge management software that actually works. The spine will likely be XML topic maps, but in terms of functionality I want the ability to hyperlink between paragraphs/lines/etc. in different PDF files, such that the user can encode their own links between topics and ideas. Obviously this would come with notes and highlighting, tagging, etc. Kind of an improved, faster Zotero.

As a sort of lead-up to that project I want to make a lightweight timesheet program that uses XML and crucially does not have a bunch of strange telemetry services running in the background. I've actually got this 99% working, but I foolishly made it as a web thing so it just breaks in random, stupid ways.
